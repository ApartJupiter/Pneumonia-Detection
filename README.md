This is a research based project and I have taken the dataset (images) through kaggle I haven't uploaded them here but you can get them from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

In this file my model on the custom dataset is present and has the accuracy around well over 85% I'll be expanding my data set soon and will commit changes as soon as I do it.

GG Happy coding!
